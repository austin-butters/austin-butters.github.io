      <h1>Sprint 3 Human Skills - Emotional Intelligence Exploration</h1>
      <h3>08 April, 2025</h3>
      <p>
        For the Human Skills section of Sprint 3, I looked explored emotional
        intelligence, what it is, and why it's important. Here's what I've
        found:
      </p>
      <h2>Mindfulness</h2>
      <h3>
        Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you
        describe them?
      </h3>
      <p>
        It's not something I've done a lot of, as I often feel really busy and
        like I don't have enough time to just "do nothing." I don't know a lot
        about mindfulness since I haven't done much of it, but it's definately
        possible I'm underestimating it's effects and usefulness. I tend to
        think that mindfulness may help me focus, but not enough to make up for
        the working time I lose by practicing mindfulness.
      </p>
      <h3>How did you find the overall experience?</h3>
      <p>
        I actually really enjoyed it, I was still tired and a little stressed
        after last sprint (though I'm trying to prioritise and schedule better
        in this sprint and future ones), so it was good to just relax and stop
        working or being busy, even if just for a few minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?</h3>
      <p>
        I will practice mindfulness before each study session where I engage
        with DevAcademy's curriculum, I will also do a mindfulness/meditation
        session every day after my morning routines (breakfast, showering, etc),
        before I go about with my day. I've only done one mindfulness session so
        far but I did enjoy it, so assuming it starts helping me significantly,
        I intend to continue this habbit into the future, after DevAcademy
        finishes.
      </p>
      <h2>Listening and Looping</h2>
      <h3>What was it like to be fully listened to?</h3>
      <p>
        Normally in conversation, you wouldn't go two minutes with only one
        person talking, so initially it felt unnatural and a little weird. I
        found it became more naturall over time, and It was good to talk about
        what was difficult or frustrating for me. It definately helped me to
        connect with Sean who I had just met for the first time in person.
      </p>
      <h3>What was it like to fully listen?</h3>
      <p>
        In most conversations, I tend to be the less talkative one, so the not
        talking aspect of it wasn't too hard. What was different was the
        listening. In most conversations, I'm half listening to the other
        person, and half thinking. In this case, I wasn't thinking about my
        response because I had to fully listen. I think it was a very good
        excersize because it helped me to get to know the other person much
        faster than I normally would have. Initially it's a bit stressful
        talking about what's difficult for me, and what I'm struggling with
        because I kind of think it makes me sound "less smart", but when you
        both do the excersise you realise you're usually in the same place.
