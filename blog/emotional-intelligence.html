      <h1>Sprint 3 Human Skills - Emotional Intelligence Exploration</h1>
      <h3>08 April, 2025</h3>
      <p><i>This page quotes the DevAcademy Student Handbook.</i></p>
      <p>
        For the Human Skills section of Sprint 3, I explored emotional
        intelligence, what it is, and why it's important. Here's what I've
        found:
      </p>
      <h2>Learning Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Self-knowledge and self-awareness can have a significant determination
        on all aspects of life, greatly affecting the way we relate to ourselves
        and others. In Sprint 3, the Human Skills curriculum develops
        self-knowledge and self-awareness by working on key Emotional
        intelligence skills. This will benefit me in both my learning journey
        and my future employability.
      </p>
      <h3>So, why learn Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        Being human is tough. We've got all these complexities in life -
        pressures of work, pressures of being at Dev Academy. We're learning a
        huge amount of stuff really quickly... and we're human with complex
        minds and complex emotions!
        <i> - DevAcademy Student Handbook, April 2025</i>
      </p>
      <h3>The Proposition</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence is the ability to monitor one's own and others'
        feelings and emotions, to discriminate amoung them, and use this
        information to guide one's thinking an actions.
        <i>
          - Salovey and Mayer, 1990 from DevAcademy Student handbook, April
          2025</i

      </p>
      <h2>My Research</h2>
      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence (EI) is also known as "EQ" for "Emotional
        Quotient. It is similar to IQ (Intelligence Quotient), but IQ and EQ
        focus on different skills. Emotional Intelligence is the grouping of
        many skills, but to summarize, it relates to the ability to recognise
        the emotions of both yourself and others, and the ability to understand,
        regulate, control, and use emotions effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a high EQ means it's easier to regulate your own emotions, and to
        understand the way your own mind works. This can be very useful when it
        comes to managing your own work, learning, relationships, and overall
        happiness. People with high EQ are often more motivated, perform higher,
        and work harder. This is not because they are inherently better workers
        or smarter people, but because they understand how to best manage
        themselves, their energy, and their motivation for work. They are also
        more empathetic and better able to understand and interact with other
        people and their emotions, which can lead to better relationships and
        human connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peter Salovey and John Mayer (psychologists and professors), define
        Emotional Intelligence as "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions
        to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion."
      </p>
      <p>
        Studies and research on Emotional Intelligence are controversial and
        there isn't a huge, evidence based scientific agreement. That aside, it
        is generally agreed that emotional intelligence, and the skills that it
        consists of, are important, life-improving skills to develop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence is comprised of many skills, which can most
        noteably be grouped into the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The ability to understand and explain what other people are feeling
        </li>
        <li>
          The ability to understand and explain what you are feeling yourself
        </li>
        <li>Self awareness of your own personal strengths and limitations</li>
        <li>Self-confidence and self-acceptance</li>
        <li>
          The ability to forgive, both your own mistakes and those of others
        </li>
        <li>
          Strong curiosity about many subjects, particularly relating to other
          people
        </li>
        <li>
          Feeling empathy towards others, being sensitive to their feelings as
          well as your own
        </li>
        <li>
          The ability to reason with and manage your own emotions in difficult
          or stressful situations
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>How is EQ different from IQ?</h3>
      <p>
        Both IQ and EQ are simply measurements of how much someone excels and
        certain skills. IQ and EQ are different groupings of skills. IQ is the
        more universally recognised and used measurement, and there is far more
        research done on IQ than EQ. IQ has a more standardised measurement
        system (for example, the average person has an IQ score of around 100),
        but EQ is harder to measure, and measurement systems are more disputed.
        There is a lot less scientific agreement on the EQ.
      </p>
      <p>
        IQ focuses on cognitive ability, such as analytical skills, pattern
        recognition, and problem solving. It can be thought of as a measurement
        of overall brainpower. EQ focuses on a different grouping of skills,
        which relate to emotions and interpersonal relationships. These skills
        include empathy, understanding emotions, communication, self-awareness,
        and so on.
      </p>
      <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
      <p>
        People with high EQ tend to be better at managing themselves, staying
        positive, staying motivated, and many more things. They often have
        better mental health and higher overall happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        People with high EQ also have greater self awareness, meaning they
        recognise and understand their own emotions, and the factors that
        contribute to the way they are feeling. By understanding these factors,
        we can understand outselves better, and be aware of the way we respond
        to our own emotions. This means that people with higher EQ have higher
        self control. Self control can be summarised as the ability to think
        before reacting to situations. By understanding why we are feeling the
        way we are feeling, we can reason with our own emotions. For example,
        rather than taking foolish action because we are feeling stressed or
        angry, we can recognise what we are feeling a certain emotion, analyse
        what factors causing emotions, and think about how best to respond
        before taking action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Empathy for others is also very important. With higher EQ comes a
        greater understanding of how our actions and behavior can influnce
        others' emotions, for better or for worse. This creates a greater sense
        of empathy, which improves relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the benefits that come with high EQ have been shown to improve
        both personal and professional lives. It improves the quality of
        relationships, the quality of work, our level of motivation, and our
        overall mental wellbeing.

      <h2>Question (From the student handbook):</h2>
      <h3>
        Can you bring to mind a time when you felt like you were in an optimal
        state of being? Where your mind was bright and clear, and there was a
        sense of capability? When weren't you being trashed by your internal
        judge or superego? A sense of stability and grounding? Aware of your
        strengths and limitations? An optimal state of being! If we want one
        word for what we're aiming for here, it's "optimal".
      </h3>
      <p>
        I can't recall a time when I've felt all of these things at once. But I
        can certainly say there are times when I feel better than others. The
        most signinficant influence is when I'm calm, rested, energised, and
        feeling physically well in general. I find that for me, my my physical
        state usually comes first, and if my physical state isn't good, my
        mental state often isn't either. I've learnt not to trust any negative
        thoughts I have about things when I'm on less than five hours of sleep,
        sick, dehydrated, or anything else that compromises my physical health.
        This is a lot, but I've found that any time I have negative thoughts
        about myself, or am feeling bad in general, there's usually a physical
        factor involved as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm feeling great physically, I usually feel better emotionally as
        well. When I'm not one hundred percent, I find that taking the time to
        relax and simply "do nothing" and just exist really helps me to clear my
        head and remove stress.
      </p>
      <h2>Reflections - Mindfulness</h2>
      <h3>
        Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you
        describe them?
      </h3>
      <p>
        It's not something I've done a lot of, as I often feel really busy and
        like I don't have enough time to just "do nothing." I don't know a lot
        about mindfulness since I haven't done much of it, but it's definately
        possible I'm underestimating it's effects and usefulness. I tend to
        think that mindfulness may help me focus, but not enough to make up for
        the working time I lose by practicing mindfulness.
      </p>
      <h3>How did you find the overall experience?</h3>
      <p>
        I actually really enjoyed it, I was still tired and a little stressed
        after last sprint (though I'm trying to prioritise and schedule better
        in this sprint and future ones), so it was good to just relax and stop
        working or being busy, even if just for a few minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?</h3>
      <p>
        I will practice mindfulness before each study session where I engage
        with DevAcademy's curriculum, I will also do a mindfulness/meditation
        session every day after my morning routines (breakfast, showering, etc),
        before I go about with my day. I've only done one mindfulness session so
        far but I did enjoy it, so assuming it starts helping me significantly,
        I intend to continue this habbit into the future, after DevAcademy
        finishes.
      </p>
      <h2>Reflections - Listening and Looping</h2>
      <h3>What was it like to be fully listened to?</h3>
      <p>
        Normally in conversation, you wouldn't go two minutes with only one
        person talking, so initially it felt unnatural and a little weird. I
        found it became more naturall over time, and It was good to talk about
        what was difficult or frustrating for me. It definately helped me to
        connect with Sean who I had just met for the first time in person.
      </p>
      <h3>What was it like to fully listen?</h3>
      <p>
        In most conversations, I tend to be the less talkative one, so the not
        talking aspect of it wasn't too hard. What was different was the
        listening. In most conversations, I'm half listening to the other
        person, and half thinking. In this case, I wasn't thinking about my
        response because I had to fully listen. I think it was a very good
        excersize because it helped me to get to know the other person much
        faster than I normally would have. Initially it's a bit stressful
        talking about what's difficult for me, and what I'm struggling with
        because I kind of think it makes me sound "less smart", but when you
        both do the excersise you realise you're usually in the same place.
