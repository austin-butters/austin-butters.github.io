      <h1>Sprint 5 Human Skills - Foundations Reflection</h1>
      <h3>24 April, 2025</h3>
      <p>
        "Utilising your journal findings and the high-level overview of the
        Human Skills learnings you have covered in Foundations - answer each of
        the following questions:"
      </p>
      <h2>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I definately do have self doubt, but at (almost) no point is that
          greater than the confidence I have that I can achieve my goals and
          that I will pull through. At times I've wondered if this is arrogance
          (self doubt) but I think it really is a healthy level of it. Although
          sometimes I do wonder if I'm a little insane doing this course because
          most other people my age aren't doing anything this intensive or
          extreme straight out of high school.
        </li>
        <li>
          My ego (referring to my thoughts about myself, not in an unhealthy
          way,) is always higher when I've done the basics to look after myself,
          like good sleep, hydration, eating, physical activity, being awake
          during daylight hours, etc. It's lower when I haven't done those
          things. As basic as those things are I really struggle to stay on top
          of them sometimes, I'm a very motivated person when it comes to the
          work I have to do but when I know I can manage without those things I
          often let myself do the bare minimum of self-care that will still let
          me keep up. "Success lies in the relentless execution of the basics",
          so I want to be better at doing more (than I "have to") to look after
          myself.
        </li>
        <li>
          From creating my learning plan, reflecting on what helps me work
          effectively, I've found that I'm not good at having lots of seperate
          systems to look after myself, be productive, etc, and I've tried many
          times to create systems for my life that will allow me to be happy and
          achieve my goals (e.g. scheduling systems, goal setting, self care
          routines, etc). For some reason when these systems are all seperate it
          bothers me, I really have no idea why that is but it just bothers me
          and everything feels "messy", so I don't keep up with it. When I do
          consolidate those systems (e.g. I wrote them all down, put them in one
          folder, and made a spreadsheet to track my progress with all of them),
          it sometimes feels like too much, and then it's almost like I've built
          myself a prison that I have to stick to and if I fail in one part the
          whole thing goes out the window for a few days. So yeah... I'm not
          good at managing myself but for some reason I just can't for the life
          of me feel like I don't have to manage myself in some way. I'm always
          good at doing the work once I get started but it's hard to start when
          I don't see a clear path, and that falls under the "self management"
          that I'm bad at, but hope to improve on. (Part of this feeling is that
          if I haven't recorded my progress in a measurable way, I feel like I
          haven't really done it, which is obviously not true.)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Values are what guide us in all aspects of life. It's what we think
        about ourselves, others, what's important/unimportant to us, and what
        motivates us. Every decision we make is guided by the values we have.
        Understanding these values is also an important aspect of self-awareness
        that helps us to stay focused.
      </p>
      <p>
        Empathy is the ability to relate to and understand other people and
        their emotions. In most cases, working as a programmer is very
        team-based so it's important to be able to communicate with and
        understand others in your team. I talked to my uncle once who works as a
        developer and he said the best coder (i.e. best technical skills) he
        ever met couldn't continuously hold a single job because he hated
        working with other people and wanted everything done in his way. Empathy
        is also very important when learning with other people, for the same
        reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-awareness is an understanding of yourself, your behaviors, values,
        how you are perceived by others, and how you exist in relation to
        others. It's essentially a great empathy for yourself. In all aspects of
        life, self-awareness is crucial to look after yourself and your own
        needs, which helps maintain happiness, reduce stress, and work
        effectively. Programming is work, and learning is also work which
        requires very high mental energy. By looking after ourselves we maximise
        our ability to work both on our own and in teams.
      </p>
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of the human skills curriculum has focused on looking after
        yourself (e.g. the Learning Plan, Mindfulness, Te Whare Tapa Whā
        learning plan), and the most surprising things to me was how effective
        these have actually been. The mindfulness has definately been useful to
        stay calm and relaxed with the study ahead. Although it has been hard to
        stick to the commitment I made in my Te Whare Tapa Whā wellbeing plan,
        I'm slowly becoming more consistent with it, building a habit, and it
        has always helped each time I've done it.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        As a less technical subject, it's hard to measure learning progress.
        I've done a good job of sticking to the timeboxes because I never know
        if I've researched/understood enough, so I always wonder if I should be
        doing more learning. The most measurable aspect of it is the depth of my
        human skills blog posts. Normally I like to measure progress I make as a
        means to stay motivated and feel proud of my achievements, which is
        harder in this case with developing "soft skills". How do you measure
        your emotional intelligence or your ability to listen/communicate? It's
        kind of impossible and even if you know progress is being made there are
        less obvious wins than there would be with the tech skills.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        You're only as good as your ability to communicate your skills. Someone
        with amazing coding skills who can't communicate and work with others is
        only percieved to be as good as their human skills, and in many cases,
        in this line of work, this perception is true. This is because most work
        in this industry is team based, working on large projects that are too
        big for one developer. Having the human skills necessary to work with
        others (good communication, empathy, self-care, etc) is invaluable.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        It definately doesn't feel like a waste of time. (Although I ocassionaly
        feel like I could spend that time becoming better at the technical
        skills, I know the human skills side is also very important and is worth
        the time spent.) I'm someone who has A LOT of things I want to do which
        I never really get started on, developing these skills in my own time
        being one of them, but this structured approach gives me a good boost to
        push myself to learn those skills outside of DevAcademy going forward
        after it's finished. Looking forward to bootcamp, I'm nervous about how
        intensive it's going to be and keeping my energy, etc, but it's a chance
        to actually meet a whole new group of people and implement the current
        Human Skills learning from foundations to the best of my ability. I hope
        we'll also go into much more depth on Human Skills during bootcamp, and
        that my skills in these areas (as well as the Tech side of course), will
        improve greatly.
