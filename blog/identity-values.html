      <h1>Sprint 1 Human Skills - Identity and Values</h1>
      <h3>29 March, 2025</h3>
      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>
      <p>
        This isn't such an obvious "ethical decision", but I think it's
        important and very relevant to me, this course, and the other questions
        here. I started my first job working at KFC when I was sixteen, and I
        continued to work there throughout the rest of my time at high school.
        As an extremely hard worker who was working long hours at such a young
        age during high school exams, I quickly became one of Management's most
        valued team members and made good friendships with many of my coworkers.
        Initially I planned to take a full gap year after finishing high school
        and study film at university in 2026. I quickly realised that the gap
        year was going to be unfulfilling, because I no longer was making any
        progress, and my job at KFC was a big time commitment that provided
        financial stability but no progress. It also provided no fulfilment as
        the job had no alignment with my personal values, it was just a
        time-for-money trade. Because I value personal development I decided I
        had to find a way to improve my skillset/career or myself in 2025, and
        DevAcademy seemed like the perfect opportunity. This was a difficult
        decision to make because normally I overthink decisions and like to
        spend way too much time weighing up all the pros, cons and consequences.
        This is what I consider to be one of my weaknesses, and I had recently
        decided to try and approach life with a "good enough" mindset (more on
        that in the following questions). I realised I didn't have to remain at
        KFC to continue those friendships. If the friendships were truely strong
        enough, I'd make the effort to maintain them, and so far I still am with
        my closest friends from there. I'm now making progress and developing
        new skills daily. I'm feeling far more satisfied with life in terms of
        both the big picture, and my day-to-day life. This was a decision I am
        very happy with now, but was hard to make at the time because it
        required me to take a risk without knowing everything. I'm so glad I
        made this decision.

      <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h2>
      <p>
        The most significant aspects of my values and identity come from my
        family. Growing up, I was taught by my parents to be a hard worker, and
        I developed this skill by doing lots of chores around the house, working
        hard on personal projects, and eventually making significant
        contributions to building the house I currently live in with my family
        (which was not something we knew how to do, and taught me to be
        persistent.) I take a lot of pride in my work ethic, and my ability to
        follow through with doing the things that I commit to doing. I've also
        had a lot of artistic influence in my life through media (e.g. movies,
        music, etc) and friends and family members who have their own creative
        endeavors. Because of this I highly value personal creativity and
        expression. My identity is significantly shaped by my family and
        friends, so I value the strong relationships I have with others, and
        nurturing them. I have had many very different "phases" of my life and
        because I tend to be optemistic, I am always excited about what changes
        the future has for me. I value self improvement and personal
        development, which is a major reason for enrolling in DevAcademy.

      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I'm naturally a logical/mathematical/methodical thinker, which has made
        it easy to pick up the basics of this course in the first week. The
        results of the "Strength testing" website linked in the student handbook
        said that my greatest stremgth is Judgement. Specifically, this means
        that I'm very good at weighing information, and I like to know all the
        facts, to make the best possible, unbiased decision. This matches my
        "INFJ" result from the Sixteen Personalities Test. Another one of my
        strengths is my strong work ethic; INFJs are known to be good at taking
        action on their goals. I have persistance and stamina, and the ability
        to work on difficult tasks for a long time, until the whole thing is
        thorougly completed to a very high standard. I'm good at disciplining
        myself to stay motivated, and sometimes I like to think I'm a little
        insane because I don't know many other people as "stubbornly motivated"
        as myself. By "stubbornly motivated", I mean I often refuse to go back
        on what I've told myself I will do. When I commit do doing something, I
        stick at it until it's thoroughly done (as previously mentioned in the
        question about "values and identity"). I'm very good at looking at both
        the big picture and the small details, and seeing how they all come
        together.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p>
        My biggest weaknesses and limitations come from the overuse of my
        strengths. Because I like to be thorough I tend to be a perfectionist,
        which often means that I don't make as much progress as I should.
        Sometimes this means I haven't done things at all if I can't do them
        perfectly. Sometimes I'm a "judger" to a fault, meaning I wait until I
        have all the information and am fully prepared to make a change in my
        life. Sometimes this waiting takes too long and I don't end up taking
        action at all. Recently I have tried to approach life with a "good
        enough" attitude, being willing to take action even if I'm don't feel
        fully ready. Things don't have to be perfect, just "good enough". A
        quote I like is that "Life rewards action, not overthinking. Take action
        first, then use the learning to recalibrate after." Normally my
        overthinking can prevent progress but recently I have been working on
        this, and this is what has allowed me to quit my previous job at KFC and
        enroll in this course. It's exciting and I look forward to the future. I
        will need to work to maintain this mindset in order to make the most of
        the learning in this course.

      <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>
      <p>
        An example of a time I was trying to work productively with others was
        in high school, when me and a group of friends were making a short film
        for our film class. As all of us were film fans, we took the project
        very seriously and invested a lot of our personal time and money into
        the project. We spent time planning, but once we were actually shooting
        the film, we realised just how hard working as a team was. The producer
        (who is in charge of everything logistics-wise) was disorganised and
        consistently showed up late. I was the director, and I was distracted by
        other things in my life and often in a world of my own. The producer was
        more experienced than I was, and as the two of us had slightly differing
        artistic visions, the producer would often override what I was wanting,
        giving instructions of his own. The whole production got very messy and
        I had to sort out a lot of the mess left behind by the producer. The
        film set was slowly falling apart so I organised a meeting with all of
        the primary crew, and we discussed what was and wasn't working with the
        production, what we were and weren't enjoying, and possible solutions to
        the problem. We realised that we had never perfectly defined our roles
        and as their weren't many of us, the roles were constantly overlapping.
        We came to the eventual solution to swap roles, meaning I would produce,
        and the previous producer would direct. This worked for the most part,
        as I was distracted creatively but was still able to sort out logistical
        things, and my friend was now able to direct properly, which is what he
        was trying to do anyway. The film set ran far more efficiently after
        this, but unfortunately we weren't able to finish the film as we had
        already gone too far over schedule before making that change. If I were
        to do this again, I'd create a more solid version plan from the
        beggining, making sure to fully define our roles and the workflow we
        would use to create the film. In that workflow, I would also include a
        process to go through any time their were conflicts, so that we could
        address and resolve them as fast as possible, and get back on track with
        our project. This could include a voting system, a chain of command, or
        any other way of resolving conflicts.
