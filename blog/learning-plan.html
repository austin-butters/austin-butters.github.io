        <h1>Sprint 2 Human Skills - My Learning Plan</h1>
        <h3>05 April, 2025</h3>
        <p>This is my learning plan, from the Human Skills section of Sprint 2. Following my plan should improve my learning.</p>
        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>I’m passionate about many different things, and at times have wanted to be an architect, developer, and a filmmaker. I think my strongest passion and most long-standing one is filmmaking, I’ve always loved movies and would love to make them myself. But I do realize that there’s not a great way to get into it and make a living off of it until you’re very successful. I’ve decided to pursue development and go to DevAcademy so that I can start a career that will hopefully go great places while I also explore filmmaking. In the future, filmmaking may become a more major pursuit, I’d have to see how it goes.</p>
        <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
        <p>My strengths and weaknesses are kind of the same thing. I’m VERY thorough. This means  that when I’m interested in something, I like to deep dive into things and learn everything I can about a particular subject. This becomes a weakness when I’m to thorough, because it makes me a perfectionist and I don’t like moving on if my knowledge on the current topic feels incomplete.</p>
        <p>My other weakness is a fairly universal one, procrastination.</p>
        <h2>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>Communication as part of a team. I recognize this is an important skill to develop and is essential for teamwork. I also know that I personally have a lot of room for improvement, because I often come to things with an I’ll-do-it-all-myself-so-it’s-exactly-how-I-want-it attitude. I’ve never worked on a coding project before, but I do have experience working in a team of filmmakers, as filmmaking is a very teamwork-based type of work. When I’ve made short films with friends, the biggest issue we face has always been communication.</p>
        <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program. This should include:</h2>
        <h3>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
        <p>Starting next sprint, to manage myself and my workload, I will skim over the entire week’s curriculum and lay out a schedule for my learning. It may be impossible to follow perfectly if things come up, but having the schedule will help me to make good progress. I’m also going to make sure to weight most of the workload towards the start of the week, so that if/when things do come up, I’ve gotten most of the work out of the way.</p>
        <p>I will do my best to make all of my communications with other students and with facilitators as clear as possible, to avoid confusion. I’ll also make sure to keep all of the messages respectful. When studying in-person for bootcamp, I will do my best to be friendly and meet everyone I’ll be working with. Socializing with new people is also a human skill that I need to work on, so I’ll make sure to focus on this for bootcamp.</p>
        <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h3>
        <p>I think I have a pretty good idea of how to deal with this as I have other experience from film projects and school deadlines, so I know how best to manage my own stress. The first thing I’ll do is step back from the work to clear my head, or if there’s not time, I’ll try my best to relax. When studying from home in foundations, that usually means getting out of the house for a while. Next, I’ll come back to the work, and ask myself if it’s good enough. I’m usually far more thorough than I need to be, and most of the time It’s actually already good enough for the level I’m learning at. If my work is still not good enough, I’ll reschedule and create a plan to finish my work by the deadline.</p>
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
        <p>When I’m stuck, and I can’t find the problem after looking and researching myself, I’ll first reach out to fellow students on either my home group or the foundations help desk on discord. I think it’s good to reach out to students as well because teaching is also a great way of learning something, so it helps everyone. After that I’ll reach out to a facilitator either on the foundations help desk, my home group, or message them directly, depending on the nature of my problem. In all situations, I’ll make my communication clear using the advice on “Asking For Help” in the student handbook. I don’t know exactly what the learning dynamic in bootcamp is, but I assume I’ll be able to use the same methods in person.</p>
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
        <p>I expect the Facilitation team to be responsive to questions and problems I may have (mostly with learning the content, but I also expect them to understand if there are unavoidable problems that may affect my ability to participate in the course, of course I will do my best to avoid these kinds of problems.) I expect them to be professional, respectful and understanding, and of course I will be respectful as well.</p>
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
        <p>I have no other strict, unchanging commitments at the moment. Usually there are one or two things that come up each week, but they’re not consistent things that can be planned on. I’ve made sure that I will always have 12:30PM on Wednesdays free for homegrown meetings.</p>
        <p>I also like to have my weekend nights away from work and study for socializing, etc, but that’s really a personal commitment to myself, that I will finish my work by then.</p>
