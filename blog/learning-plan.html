      <h1>Sprint 5 Human Skills - My Updated Learning Plan</h1>
      <h3>24 April, 2025 (Updated)</h3>
      <p>
        Sprint 5 is the last full sprint for DevAcademy foundations. To prepare
        for bootcamp, I'm reflecting on my learning plan throughout foundations
        and updating it in preparation for bootcamp.
      </p>
      <h2>Reassess your Learning Plan</h2>
      <p>
        <i>
          "The pressures and challenges of Bootcamp will be different from those
          in Foundations and the type of help and support available to you. We
          will revisit similar questions to those that you answered when first
          formulating your Learning Plan, but now with a particular focus on
          learning goals and objectives while on Bootcamp. Take some time to
          reflect on these questions and record your answers in a document."
        </i>
      </p>
      <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        <i>
          "What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course
          for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do
          you have a destination in mind?"
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        It remains mostly the same as when I first made my learning plan, but I
        will add some more details. After this course I have a potential
        oportunity to do some work for
        <a href="https://www.volition.org.nz/" target="_blank"
          >Volition Solutions LTD</a
        >, which is an app that allows disabled people to record their
        preferences so they can receive the best possible support. If I do get
        to do this work, it'll have a great social impact. Of course, currently
        that is a possibility, nothing is definite.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other thing I've noticed is that I've really enjoyed all of the
        projects so far, so I'd like to think that I might work on some sort of
        personal project for something I'm passionate about, if the right idea
        strikes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll also be looking for general development work of course, but as of
        the current moment I don't have strong opinions about exactly what kind
        it would be.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p>
        <i>
          "Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your
          idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any
          new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder
          you during Bootcamp?"
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest strength will probably be keeping up with the technical
        content. I totally expect to be confused a lot (or even most) of the
        time, but I expect that I'll do fine keeping up with everything. So far
        I've done a very good job of keeping up (and often even finishing the
        week's work before the weekend), so I know I'm good at pulling through
        with deadlines, and I'm pretty happy with my comprehension and ability
        to learn technical things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've noticed more and more during foundations that I'm really bad at
        sticking to the basics of looking after myself (consistent sleep,
        staying hydrated, eating well), I tend to do less than is ideal, as long
        as I know I'll still be able to finish the work. I would have liked to
        think that before DevAcademy this was mostly just because I didn't have
        any reason to do these things because I wasn't studying or doing
        particularly important work. I've since come to realise that it's more
        of a mindset I have that keeps me doing that (mostly with the unhealthy
        sleep schedule), so this will be my biggest weakness going into
        bootcamp. It's not directly learning related, but the better I do at
        these things, the better I am able to learn. I'm hoping that the more
        rigid structure of bootcamp will motivate (or force) me to start
        developing better habits and routines with this, that I can retain after
        the course.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h2>
      <p>
        <i>
          "While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is
          not what we would like you to consider in this plan. Non-technical
          challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in
          groups, speaking in front of the group, keeping focused for nine
          weeks, etc."
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest non-technical challenge will be working in groups. I need to
        improve my teamwork skills and I hope to do so in bootcamp. This will be
        particularly difficult for me when people have differing ideas to me and
        also when working on different schedules (both of which are to be
        expected in the workforce so are important skills).
      </p>
      <h2>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        <i>
          "At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and
          improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some
          areas for development you would like to work on? For example, this
          could be communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others,
          giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or
          improving your self-awareness and reflective skills."
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        A big goal for me in bootcamp regarding human skills is to improve my
        communication and teamwork skills for group projects. I'm usually very
        good at working hard on personal projects but not always the best at
        working collaboratively, especially when differing opinions are
        involved. I know that I need to work on my ability to let others
        contribute to my projects, even if they have different ways of doing
        things, and I need to not get hung up on minor details as a result of
        the fact that I'm still learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest non-technical challenge in bootcamp will be improving said
        skills.
      </p>
      <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      <p>
        <i>
          "What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the
          same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is helpful to voice
          these expectations."
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        I expect facilitators to be respectful and understanding of
        struggles/issues I may have during the course, and I expect to be able
        to communicate with facilitators regularly about this. For me, ideally
        support just involves being able to check in with someone who can guide
        me in the right direction (not giving me answers or anything, but enough
        advice to keep me learning on my own).
      </p>
      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        <i>
          "Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help
          in a timely way? Write down a commitment to how you will manage your
          workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of
          how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with
          other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives."
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        My expectations for myself are to give it my all. I'll do my best to
        maintain a positive attitude and be respectful and friendly to other
        students and facilitators. I will do my best to look after myself in my
        personal life so that I am in the best position to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        When have run into problems or blockers that I can't solve with research
        or just thinking about it, I'll first reach out to other students for
        help, then facilitators. When seeking help, I will do so in a respectful
        manner, and make sure I understand the problem I am having to the best
        of my ability so I can clearly communicate it to the person I'm seeking
        help from. I usually find that I learn best when I've solved a problem
        on my own so I like to think about the problem and research solutions
        myself first, but I do recognise that bootcamp will be intensive and
        there may not always be time to solve every problem on my own. For this
        reason, I'll make sure to reach out for help after I've tried to solve a
        problem on my own for some time (This amount of time will of course
        differ, depending on the size of the problem, but generally, I think
        that 20-30 minutes on a bug or technical issue is reasonable.)
      </p>
      <p>
        To manage my workload, I'll continue to use the techniques I've
        previously used. This includes skimming over the week's curriculum
        beforehand so that I can better plan and schedule my work. I'll continue
        to use the techniques I previously talked about in sprint 2 (See below
        on this page), which have already improved my procrasination habit.
        Additionally, I've found that the two minute anti-procrastination
        technique works very well for me too. (This technique involves forcing
        yourself to work for two minutes, allowing yourself to stop after. More
        often than not, this is enough time to sink in and continue working.) I
        also expect bootcamp to have a more rigid structure that makes
        procrastination harder, but it's still important that I manage my
        procrastination.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with seeking help, I'll try to make all of my communications clear
        and respectful with other students, facilitators, and industry/community
        representatives so that work can be as productive as possible without
        time being lost to communication.

      <h1>Sprint 2 Human Skills - My Learning Plan</h1>
      <h3>05 April, 2025</h3>
      <p>
        This is my learning plan, from the Human Skills section of Sprint 2.
        Following my plan should improve my learning.
      </p>
      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about many different things, and at times have wanted to
        be an architect, developer, and a filmmaker. I think my strongest
        passion and most long-standing one is filmmaking, I’ve always loved
        movies and would love to make them myself. But I do realize that there’s
        not a great way to get into it and make a living off of it until you’re
        very successful. I’ve decided to pursue development and go to DevAcademy
        so that I can start a career that will hopefully go great places while I
        also explore filmmaking. In the future, filmmaking may become a more
        major pursuit, I’d have to see how it goes.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>
      <p>
        My strengths and weaknesses are kind of the same thing. I’m VERY
        thorough. This means that when I’m interested in something, I like to
        deep dive into things and learn everything I can about a particular
        subject. This becomes a weakness when I’m to thorough, because it makes
        me a perfectionist and I don’t like moving on if my knowledge on the
        current topic feels incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>My other weakness is a fairly universal one, procrastination.</p>
      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Communication as part of a team. I recognize this is an important skill
        to develop and is essential for teamwork. I also know that I personally
        have a lot of room for improvement, because I often come to things with
        an I’ll-do-it-all-myself-so-it’s-exactly-how-I-want-it attitude. I’ve
        never worked on a coding project before, but I do have experience
        working in a team of filmmakers, as filmmaking is a very teamwork-based
        type of work. When I’ve made short films with friends, the biggest issue
        we face has always been communication.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program. This
        should include:
      </h2>
      <h3>
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
        safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
        representatives
      </h3>
      <p>
        Starting next sprint, to manage myself and my workload, I will skim over
        the entire week’s curriculum and lay out a schedule for my learning. It
        may be impossible to follow perfectly if things come up, but having the
        schedule will help me to make good progress. I’m also going to make sure
        to weight most of the workload towards the start of the week, so that
        if/when things do come up, I’ve gotten most of the work out of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to procrastination, I've realised that I have a specific
        amount of work to do each week. Every minute of work that I do on Monday
        is work that I don't have to do on the weekend. By thinking in this way,
        I've managed to successfully get a lot of work done at the start of the
        week, even without a close deadline hanging over me. I've also told my
        friends and family about this approach, and they recognise that my time
        is valuable so they're holding me accountable for this. Overall, this
        will help me to be far less stressed by the workload.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing that will help me to stay productive is maintaining my
        physical health. I'm going to focus on healthy eating and hydration,
        getting enough sleep and not having caffiene after 2PM.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will do my best to make all of my communications with other students
        and with facilitators as clear as possible, to avoid confusion. I’ll
        also make sure to keep all of the messages respectful. When studying
        in-person for bootcamp, I will do my best to be friendly and meet
        everyone I’ll be working with. Socializing with new people is also a
        human skill that I need to work on, so I’ll make sure to focus on this
        for bootcamp.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think I have a pretty good idea of how to deal with this as I have
        other experience from film projects and school deadlines, so I know how
        best to manage my own stress. The first thing I’ll do is step back from
        the work to clear my head, or if there’s not time, I’ll try my best to
        relax. When studying from home in foundations, that usually means
        getting out of the house for a while. Next, I’ll come back to the work,
        and ask myself if it’s good enough. I’m usually far more thorough than I
        need to be, and most of the time It’s actually already good enough for
        the level I’m learning at. If my work is still not good enough, I’ll
        reschedule and create a plan to finish my work by the deadline.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p>
        When I’m stuck, and I can’t find the problem after looking and
        researching myself, I’ll first reach out to fellow students on either my
        home group or the foundations help desk on discord. I think it’s good to
        reach out to students as well because teaching is also a great way of
        learning something, so it helps everyone. After that I’ll reach out to a
        facilitator either on the foundations help desk, my home group, or
        message them directly, depending on the nature of my problem. In all
        situations, I’ll make my communication clear using the advice on “Asking
        For Help” in the student handbook. I don’t know exactly what the
        learning dynamic in bootcamp is, but I assume I’ll be able to use the
        same methods in person.
      </p>
      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p>
        I expect the Facilitation team to be responsive to questions and
        problems I may have (mostly with learning the content, but I also expect
        them to understand if there are unavoidable problems that may affect my
        ability to participate in the course, of course I will do my best to
        avoid these kinds of problems.) I expect them to be professional,
        respectful and understanding, and of course I will be respectful as
        well.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have no other strict, unchanging commitments at the moment. Usually
        there are one or two things that come up each week, but they’re not
        consistent things that can be planned on. I’ve made sure that I will
        always have 12:30PM on Wednesdays free for homegrown meetings.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like to have my weekend nights away from work and study for
        socializing, etc, but that’s really a personal commitment to myself,
        that I will finish my work by then.
