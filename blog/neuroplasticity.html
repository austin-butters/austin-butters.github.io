      <h1>Sprint 4 Human Skills - Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
      <h3>14 April, 2025</h3>
      <p>
        For my first Human Skills blog post, I'll be posting my notes from my
        exploration into neuroplasticity and growth mindsets.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <h3>
        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Research into neuroplasticity shows us that our brains are adapting and
        rewiring themselves every day to optemise for new
        learning/skills/habits. Neuroplasticity has far reaching implications
        that impact all aspects of our lives. For the most part, this is a good
        thing. It allows us to improve ourselves (through learning, developing
        good habits, changing our ways of thinking, etc), but it's also
        responsible for the bad habits and behaviours we may have, such as
        addiction. By understanding the science of neuroplasticity, people can
        make sure that their behaviors align with their goals to rewire their
        brains in the desired way that will change them for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research has also shown that teaching neuroplasticity to students and
        workers improves learning and performance. Many people are still stuck
        in the old scientific belief that our adult brains are in a fixed state.
        By understanding that this is not true, students and workers will have a
        better understanding of how they can train their brains to learn new
        things. This works better than simply telling someone "You can do it!",
        because it gives them the real science that will help them to understand
        what they need to do to reach their goals. Science is far more
        believable than just being told it's possible, and creates real
        motivation based on actual understanding.

      <h3>
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplacticity for
        your benefit.
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the student handbook's content, I was taught the A.G.E.S. learning
        model:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Attention - To learn effectively, you need to be able to properly
          focus on something. This means minimising distractions and giving
          yourself the nessicary time to "sink in" to the learning. The more
          focused you are on your learning, the more you will remember it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generation - Generate meaningful connections. What does this mean? To
          generate meaningful connections, you have to put new concepts and
          ideas in context of what you already know. Rather than focusing on
          memorization, focus on context and understanding. With those, the
          memorization will come naturally. As mentioned earlier, when we learn
          new things, we form new neural pathways. By repeating mental
          processes, we strengthen those pathways. Rather than creating an
          entirely new pathway from scratch, a more efficient approach is to
          make connections between new learning and what you already know. This
          allows you to build of of existing pathways that are already strong.
        </li>
        <li>
          Emotion - The way you feel about things greatly influences how they
          interact with them. You also tend to have the strongest, most vivid
          memories of experiences with deep emotions. By attaching emotions to
          your learning, you can increase your memory of it, as well as your
          motivation towards learning. This could be rewards for completing
          assignments, or looking forward to the benifits that a course of study
          will give you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spacing - The most effective learning is done in "chunks". This means
          spacing learning out and giving yourself time to absorb the nessicary
          knowledge. Learning too much in one big block can cause burnout and
          you will likely forget some of it. Rather than overwhelming yourself
          with too much new knowledge, focus on repetition and practice, not
          memorization. Letting information process through time (spacing),
          repitition and practice is the most effective way to move information
          from the short to long-term memory.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        With this knowledge, I'll engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
        in a few ways.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Firstly, with each new concept I learn in DevAcademy, and with each
          new sprint, I put the new concepts in context of the old ones. For
          example, I might think to myself "Okay, I see how Concept B relates to
          Concept A from last week", or "Concept A and Concept B make more sense
          now, because I can see how Concept C links them together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deep focus - I've been coming in to campus often during foundations.
          Not because I can't study at home, but because arriving at a dedicated
          location puts my brain in "study mode", and there are no other
          distractions to get in the way of my learning. At home, if I want to
          take a break I may find myself wasting time, e.g. sitting on my bed on
          social media, but on campus it's a much more planned, dedicated study
          session, so the breaks are still focused.
        </li>
        <li>
          Emotion and goals - I've just finished high school, and previously
          during this time I was working a fast food job at KFC. It was really
          boring. I quit that job to study at DevAcademy, so I'm already really
          enjoying it more than before, and the contrast is very obvious. This
          means that my day-to-day life has gone from boring while at KFC to
          exciting while at DevAcademy, so I already have positive emotional
          associations with the learning process that I've gotten into.
          Secondly, I've set goals for the latter half of 2025 to look forward
          to. I'm hoping to have a better job than before, and with higher pay
          than fast food, I'll move into a new, nicer place. I've been keeping
          these goals in mind as positive reinforcement throughout all of my
          study.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spacing - To avoid burnout, I've been working hard to finish all of my
          work before sunday, so that I have a day off when I can "do nothing".
          Even when not actively studying, the knowledge from the week is still
          processing/sinking in, which means I'll be ready to start the next
          sprint on Monday, and having the day to relax also helps me to avoid
          burnout.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        Previously, many scientists believed that the human brain developed only
        during childhood and afterwards was fixed. Recently, better research and
        understanding has proven that this is completely false. Our brain is
        made of approximately 100,000,000,000 neurons and each of these neurons
        form countless connections between eachother. Different mental processes
        create signals in different neurons, which travel through the
        connections (known as neural pathways), allowing us to remember things,
        feel emotion, think specific thoughts, and perform specific tasks. The
        more we repeat something, the more often this neural pathway is
        stimulated, and the stronger it becomes. Imagine a pathway like a road,
        the more "traffic" is on that road, the more lanes are needed and the
        stronger that road becomes. As the road (neural pathway) becomes
        stronger, tasks and thought processes become easier to repeat until they
        eventually become second nature. It's no different from a muscle that we
        need to excersise. The process of forming new roads and removing old
        ones is called "neuroplasticity". When we learn new things, our brains
        literally rewire themselves to optemise for the new
        knowledge/skill/habit we have developed. It's not innacurate to say that
        (if "we" are our minds), we can transform ourselves into entirely new
        people based on our habits and behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        The A.G.E.S. learning model is a great way to increase neuroplasticity.
        By optemising these four variables (as listed previously), we can
        improve our mind's neuroplasticity, our ability to learn. When
        researching this, the thing that stood out the most to me was the "G",
        for Generation. This is about "generating meaningful connections" with
        knowledge/skills/habits we already have. Previously I talked about
        thinking of neural pathways as roads that become highways when traffic
        increases. By putting new learning in context with previous
        understanding, we don't have to build new roads from scratch. We can use
        an existing highway and simply add on-ramps and off-ramps.

      </div>
      <p>
        The more we engage with activities that challenge both our brain and
        body, the more neural pathways we will form. Engaging in mentally
        stimulating activities not only helps you form pathways directly related
        to new learning, but it helps you to form pathways that make the
        learning and thinking process a habit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I'd say a big one is maintaining your physical health too. Your
        body and mind are interlinked, as are your physical and mental energy
        levels. This means getting good sleep, staying hydrated, and eating well
        to give both your body and mind the best ability to focus and learn.

        I only skimmed this, but I found it very interesting, as it goes into
        some actual neuron science which gives useful understanding into
        neuroplasticity.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Research Growth Mindset</h2>
      <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
      <img
        class="in-post-image"
        src="../assets/images/0022-growth-mindset.png"
        alt="Growth Mindset"
      />
      <p></p>
      <p>
        One of the key ideas of the growth mindset is not being stuck in the
        present. Rather than thinking "I can't do this", It's about not being
        able to do it "yet". "You" aren't just the present version of yourself,
        you're always changing and if you continue to practice and learn, you
        will eventually be able to achieve those goals. Having a growth mindset
        is closely linked to an understanding of neuroplasticity. Firstly,
        studies show that when students and workers are taught about the actual
        science of neuroplasticity, their mindsets tend to shift towards a
        growth mindset. A growth mindset is not just about pure motivation,
        which often changes day-to-day, it's about understanding that consistent
        effort will result in change, and your current state does not represent
        you as a person completely. It's about taking pride in the improvement
        process, not just your current state. In the end, someone who is
        "successful" but fixed in their current state will always be surpassed
        by someone who is constantly improving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individuals with a growth mindset are less averse to challenge,
        difficulty and failure. They understand that confusion and failure are
        not signs of "being dumb", but signs that they are in the learning
        process, and taking real action towards improvement. This is the real
        way learning is done. Because these people are challenging themselves
        more than those with a fixed mindset, they create and strengthen new
        neural pathways more effectively, and they are the ones who fully
        benifit from neuroplasticity.
      </p>
      <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
      <p>
        When researching, I found that it's possible to have a growth mindset in
        some areas, but a fixed mindset in others. It made me think about which
        aspects of my own mindset are growth and fixed, which is definately
        something I should do some reflecting on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also found it interesting that some studies say praising intelligence
        creates a fixed mindset. Some studies have shown that praising traits
        like intelligence create a mindset that you can either be "smart" or
        "not smart" from a young age. To improve this, it's better to praise
        effort in learning.
      </p>
      <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>
        I was frequently taught about having a growth mindset in primary school,
        but it always felt a little fake to me, because we were simply told to
        add the word "yet" to everything, e.g. "I can't do it... yet", but not
        taught any of the actual reasons why we were doing it. And then the
        schools praise/critizism was tied to a student's current abilities
        rather than their engagement with the learning process. I now have a
        better understanding of what the real point of a growth mindset is,
        which I wasn't taught in school as a kid.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm somewhat confused about many of the concepts that I'm being taught
        in DevAcademy but I'm not panicking about that, because I know it's part
        of the learning process. Already, there are many things I can
        confidently do now that I couldn't understand just a few weeks ago in
        earlier sprints. Every mistake I've made when writing code is sometihng
        that I've learnt from and am less likely to repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll set learning progress goals, not just achievement goals. This could
        mean I have a goal to "Understand X" or "Be able to explain how Y
        works", rather than a goal to "Be a successful programmer" and "Make X
        dollars".
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll do my best to understand that mistakes are the best way of
        learning, and every time I make a mistake my skill increases.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a good summary of the difference between a growth and fixed
        mindset.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Blend with your learning plan and strategies.</h2>
      <h3>
        Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
        learning plan and strategy.
      </h3>
      <p>
        This understanding of neuroplasticity and a growth mindset will
        influence my learning plan in a few ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Firstly, I'll make sure to at all times be aware that confusion and
          hard effort are a good thing. If something is easy, I'm probably not
          challenging myself enough.
        </li>
        <li>
          In previous weeks I haven't had a lot of time for stretch material,
          but last week I had a little time to spare, so I started on some of
          the stretch challenges for the JavaScript Cafe. I worked through what
          I could, but once I got to challenges where I felt like I had no clue
          how to do them, I moved on. This week I may or may not have a lot of
          time for stretch material, but If I do, I'm going to allow myself to
          exist in a state of total confusion. Even if I have absolutely no idea
          what to do, I can still sit for some time and think about he problem.
          If I don't find the perfect solution, it's still gotten me to think,
          which is a success in an of itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the end of each sprint, when filling out the end-of-sprint-x.md
          reflection, I'll think about what progress (big or small) I've made
          that week, e.g. a topic or skill I didn't know about or understand,
          that I now do, or even just something complicated becoming slightly
          easier. I think reflection and recognising successes in the learning
          process in this way are an important part of staying motivated.
