      <h1>Sprint 4 Technical - Problem Solving</h1>
      <h3>19 April, 2025</h3>
      <p>
        In Sprint 4, I continued to refine my JavaScript knowledge by completing
        challenges (Javascript Kata), during which I had to solve many problems.
      </p>
      <p>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</p>
      <h2>Were blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
      <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
      <p>
        In the gradebook challenge, I got very confused when the function I
        wrote to add test scores wasn't working. It was simply returning
        "undefined", instead of an existing testScores array.
      </p>
      <h3>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p>
        I read online, and spend a while looking through my code to find the
        issue. I was frustrated at first but then I decided to just take a break
        and come back to the problem. When I came back to the problem, I started
        with the basics. First, I needed to talk myself through the problem so
        that I fully understood it (Rubber Ducky Method). In the process of
        doing so, I read over the error message in full. Before this, I only
        skimmed it and saw some value "undefined", but when I read the whole
        error message I noticed it said "testscores is undefined". I'd been
        looking at the wrong thing, rather than focusing on what was evaluating
        to "undefined", I simply needed to change "testscores" to "testScores",
        and it fixed everything.
      </p>

      />
      <img

        src="../assets/images/0026-code-problem-solving-testScores.png"
        alt="Corrected code"
      />
      <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>
        Frustrated at first, but calm after I took a break. I remained calm as I
        worked my way through the basic problem solving techniques until I found
        the problem.
      </p>
      <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
      <p>
        Often, the biggest part of solving a problem is to simply understand
        what the problem is. Understanding the problem is an important step that
        can be achieved in a number of ways (e.g. Rubber Ducky method, Reading
        error messages, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also usually best to work your way through some of the basic
        problem solving techniques (pseudocoding, console.log()ing, rubber
        ducky, error messages, etc.), because often the source of the problem
        will jump out at you.
      </p>
      <h2>Elegantly solved a problem:</h2>
      <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
      <p>
        For the Super Flip Flop challenge, I wanted to try and employ problem
        solving techniques preventatively, to minimize confusion later on in the
        process.
      </p>
      <h3>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing I did was research. I didn't know about the remainder
        operator, so I looked online (MDN web docs, W3Schools) to find out how
        it worked. Researching helped me solve the problem more effeciently and
        elegantly. (Had I not researched the remainder operator, I probably
        would have divided a number, the subtracted it from it's own
        Math.floor(), if 0, no remainder meaning it is a multiple. By
        researching I found a much more consise way of solving the problem.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, I made sure to write good pseudocode. When pseudocoding I
        realised some errors that I would run into with the order I was doing
        things, which would have returned multiple values, so I had to change
        it. This made me very glad that I pseudocoded because If I hadn't, It
        would have been much more confusing when I ran into those problems.
      </p>

      />
      <img
        class="in-post-image"
        src="../assets/images/0028-code-fliplop-pseudocode-fixed.png"
        alt="Corrected pseudocode"
      />
      <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>
        Much more calm and confident than in previous challenges, because I was
        using the problem solving techniques preventatively, so I had created a
        map for myself to solve the problem. I was a lot more focused and clear
        on what I was doing.
      </p>
      <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
      <p>
        It's best to also use these problem solving techniques preventatively,
        as part of the planning process. Not just to solve problems once they do
        arise. Having a clear plan helps you to remain focused and avoid
        creating bugs. Planning also allowed me to write what I think is the
        best possible solution, not just any solution that works.

      <h2>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:
      </h2>
      <h3>Pseudocode - 9/10</h3>
      <p>Pseudocoding is the problem solving technique I'm strongest at.</p>
      <p>
        Pseudocoding is about breaking a probem into smaller, more managable
        subproblems that if solved, will add together to solve the larger
        problem. This is done by commenting steps of what the code should do
        before you actually begin coding. Pseudocoding means that you can tackle
        a problem one step at a time, without worrying about everything at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        When psuedocoding, write in in plain english, using comments, the steps
        the code needs to follow to achieve it's goal. You don't have to worry
        about all the details about how it will do that, that's what the actual
        coding is for. Just worry about what it should do at each step.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pseudocode is also important for collaboration. By having steps laid out
        in plain english, other developers can contribute after you've finished
        working. It's also useful because it's universal - all developers will
        be able to read and understand it no matter which programming languages
        they use. It breaks a task down to it's core logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        When pseudocoding, it's important to be clear and concise, so that it's
        easily understandable. It's especially important to be clear on
        important details like an algorithms desired inputs, etc, but avoid
        overcomplicating it
      </p>
      <h3>Trying Something - 6.5/10</h3>
      <p>
        In the Sprint 4 Javascript Kata, I sometimes tried things out without
        researching deeply, and sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. It's
        not usually a first resort, but I've seen it can work sometimes, so with
        practice, I'll eventually get a sense of if this is the best course of
        action, depending on the complexity of the situation.
      </p>
      <h3>Rubber Ducky Method - 7/10</h3>
      <p>
        Involves explaining the problem to a "rubber duck", but really it's just
        a method of working through the problem, what you're expecting, what's
        not working and what is, and very often, in the process of explaining
        it, you'll realise what the problem is.
      </p>
      <p>
        This method has worked for me before, and I'd rate my confidence using
        this technique at a 7/10. I could definately improve by practicing it
        more.
      </p>
      <h3>Reading Error Messages - 8/10</h3>
      <p>
        Error messages often point out exactly what or where the problem is, or
        at least what type of problem is being dealt with. They're extremely
        useful and reading them can give a lot of insight into debugging.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I'm getting a lot better at reading error messages, and I'd put
        my current ability at an 8/10.
      </p>
      <h3>Console.log()-ing - 8/10</h3>
      <p>
        Allows you to log the current state of data and other information at a
        specific point in a program. It's very useful for seeing what's
        happening behind the scenes in a program.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is one of my first resorts when I run into a problem and it usually
        helps me figure out what's going on.
      </p>
      <h3>Googling - 9/10</h3>
      <p>
        Along with pseudocoding this is one of my strongest skills. I don't
        think I've ever been unable to find answers.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking your peers for help - 7/10</h3>
      <p>
        I'm pretty confident with my ability to use this technique, but I've
        given it a 7 because it's not really something I do a lot. I will do it
        if needed, but it's usually a last resort for me and I usually solve the
        problem with another technique before I arrive here.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking coaches for help - 7/10</h3>
      <p>
        Like asking students, I'm usually able to solve a problem on my own
        before I need to (or before I would naturally) ask for help.
      </p>
      <h3>Improving your process with reflection - 6.5/10</h3>
      <p>
        Allows you to indentify your own strengths and weaknesses with coding
        and problem solving, avoid developing bad habits, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being very new to coding, I'd say I've only had a very small amount of
        time to think about my coding process and understand where it falls
        relative to others, and what techniques I'm over or underutilising. I
        think I will have a lot of improvement here, and more practice with this
        technique. (Writing this blog post is an example of this).
      </p>
      <h2>
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
        you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the Sprint 4 JavaScript Kata, I ran into many small errors that each
        took a while to solve. I was able to solve all of them on my own, but
        every one of them took long enough to solve that I wondered if I would
        be able to solve them without asking for help. I was reluctant to ask
        for help because I like to know that ("I can do it myself.") It's not
        that I'm embarrassed to ask (I think), it's just that I like to think
        that the goal of my learning is to have all of this knowledge in my
        head, so I always try on my own until I can't think of anything else
        before asking for help.
      </p>
      <p>
        A specific example would be in the deBee challenge, where I had to
        remove all the buzzes from a sentence (e.g. the sentence "I'm buzz being
        BUZz attacked Buzz buZz by bUzz bees! BUZZ" would need to return "I'm
        being attacked by bees!"). I pseudocoded, then wrote the code that was
        needed, but the tests still weren't passing. I spend a long time
        researching the various methods I'd used in the code but I still
        couldn't find anything wrong with it. At this point I considered asking
        for help but I tried one last thing. I console.log()-ed the results of
        my function and found that the return value was "buzz buzz buzz". This
        helped me to find the issue, a simple mistake using "==" instead of
        "!=".
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, I feel like I learnt more by persevering by myself. The
        only issue was, I may have gone a little over time on that challenge. In
        future, I will still aim to solve everything with the knowledge I
        already have, but be better at recognizing that feedback and responses
        from others are also a valid form of learning, and If it's required to
        stay within the alotted time, I should be more quick to ask for help.
