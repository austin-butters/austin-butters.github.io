      <h1>Sprint 4 Human Skills - Te Whare Tapa Whā Wellbeing Plan</h1>
      <h3>14 April, 2025</h3>
      <p>
        I'm going to create a wellbeing plan using Tā Mason Durie’s Te Whare
        Tapa Whā model. This is a hollistic wellbeing model that focuses on for
        main aspects of wellbeing, represented as walls of a wharenui. All the
        walls work together to hold the structure together. If one wall falls,
        so do the rest. All four walls are build on a strong foundation that
        connects it to the land.
      </p>
      <img
        class="in-post-image"
        src="../assets/images/0024-te-whare-tapa-wha.png"
        alt="Te Whare Tapa Whā"
      />
      <p>
        Some activities support and strengthen more than one of the walls,
        they'll be included them in more than one place.
      </p>
      <p>
        This new wellbeing plan goes in conjunction with my learning plan from
        Sprint 2, and my mindfulness plan from sprint 3. By committing to all of
        these, I'll have the best possible learning experience. I'll continue
        focusing on my wellbeing after the end of my study at DevAcademy.
      </p>
      <h2>My Wellbeing Plan</h2>
      <h3>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prioritising a full eight hours of sleep a day, Ideally going to bed
          much earlier than I am used to, around 10:00PM
        </li>
        <li>
          Going on walks first thing in the morning, to get out of the house.
        </li>
        <li>
          Staying physically active, going to the gym at least twice a week (and
          if I don't have time, exercising at home.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Eating healthy - Recently I've been eating a lot more wholefoods and
          I'm feeling much better physically so I plan to continue this.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make sure to spend time with friends at least once a week (ideally
          after completing the majority of the week's study, so I'll have to
          prioritise well and focus for the beginning of the week.)
        </li>
        <li>
          While at home with family, spend at least one hour a day being fully
          present with people instead of studying on my computer.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prioritising a full eight hours of sleep a day, Ideally going to bed
          much earlier than I am used to, around 10:00PM. Also making sure that
          the eight hours of sleep takes place during reasonable hours, getting
          up by 8:00AM at the absolute latest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taking regular breaks when studying, and not mentally stimulating ones
          (e.g. take a walk or stare at a wall, rather than scrolling social
          media.)
        </li>
        <li>Continue to practice mindfulness.</li>
        <li>
          Mentally declutter by journalling and "brain-dumping", usually nightly
          for a short time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Continue to practice mindfulness.</li>
        <li>
          Spend time in nature with walks each morning, and at least once a week
          go on a longer walk for a few hours.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>

          go on a longer walk for a few hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Just sit under a tree for a while (I know it's simple but it really
          works for me.)
        </li>
      </ul>
